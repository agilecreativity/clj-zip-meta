# What it is? 

clj-zip-meta reads zip/jar files and returns the contained meta data (as defined by the [zip file specification](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT) ), as clojure data structures.

A zip/jar file has the general format: 

```
      [local file header 1]
      [encryption header 1]
      [file data 1]
      [data descriptor 1]
      . 
      .
      .
      [local file header n]
      [encryption header n]
      [file data n]
      [data descriptor n]
      
      [archive decryption header] 
      [archive extra data record] 
      
      [central directory header 1]
      .
      .
      .
      [central directory header n]
      [zip64 end of central directory record]
      [zip64 end of central directory locator] 
      [end of central directory record]
```

This library reads the meta data (local headers, central directory headers, and end of central directory record) data as god and the zip file specification intended, by scanning from the end of the file for the end-of-central-directory record and locating the central directory based on the end-of-central-directory record. This is in contrast to a number of zip implementations out there which break if the zip file has prefix bytes before the data (like self extracting zip files).

Note that the aim of this library is quite different and way more detailed than what implementations such as java's ZipFile and friends does. The goal of this libray is to give the user unfettered read/write access to the binary layer of zip files. 

This means that this implementation will return way more data than what you get from ZipFile and friends and will let you manipulate this data to your hearts content. This also means that this implementation will be able to (within reason) read meta data for corrupt zip files which other implementations might just give up with

# What it is not
This library was not written to extract files or data out of zip or jar files, there are other libraries (and ZipFile, ZipInputStream etc from java) out there for that. 


# Status
This library was just (September 2017) created and depends on a not-yet-released version (based on a [pull request](https://github.com/funcool/octet/pull/11) by me to support some features required by this project) of octet, a clojure binary format library. 

The library can read zip meta data and for very specific needs, can update the meta data as well. Robustness and/or completeness might or might not come in the future. 

## Usage
The main entry point to this library is the `zip-meta`: 

```clojure
(zip-meta "~/.m2/repository/org/clojure/java.classpath/0.2.2/java.classpath-0.2.2.jar")

(with some of the records omitted for brevity).

There are also methods for fixing a preluded zip file and writing changes to the zip file meta data. I will try to document and polish these up some time soon. 

# Why would you do this? 
When I started looking at zip files in clojure I could not find a single library on the JVM which actually reads the zip file meta data. I'm not talking about reading entries like java's ZipFile etc, I'm talking about the actual binary format details of the zip specification. 

This library solves that problem. In other words, give a zip file, this library will let you read and manipulate the zip end of cetral directory record, all the central directory records, and all the local records. See output in the Usage section for an example of how this data can look. 

With that being said, this library was initially created for the sole purpose of creating valid executable jar files. We are here talking about executable in the sense that you run the jar file as a command, i.e. `myjarfile.jar <options>` and not via `java -jar <jar-file-name> <options>`.

To accomplish this we create a normal uber/fat jar, we set the jar file executable bit, and we then prepend a prelude bash / bat snippet to the front of the zip file. According to the zip file specification this is at this point still a valid zip archive. This means that all utilities like unzip, winzip and java still consider this file valid (almost, see below) and do not see the prelude byetes. 

The problem is that just prepending without altering the zip file meta-data invalidates all the offsets in the zip meta and all the offsets are now off by however many bytes the prelude snippet was. 

This typically results in the following kind of messaging from zay unzip: 

```
$ unzip -l bad_prelude.zip 

Archive:  src/test/resources/bad_prelude.zip
warning [src/test/resources/bad_prelude.zip]:  317 extra bytes at beginning or within zipfile
  (attempting to process anyway)
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
...
...
$
```

in this case the zip file was still read since the unzip implementation does the sane thing. A lot of tools however give up at this point: 

```
$ zipdetails bad_prelude.zip 

No Central Directory found

$
```

This library allows you to update the zip meta offsets and regain zip file integrity after prepending a prelude script to the file.
